# Network & Security Home Lab (Personal Project)

## Objective
Build hands-on skills for an entry-level NOC / Junior Network Engineer role through a multi-vendor lab focused on segmentation, firewall policy, and troubleshooting.

## What I built
- Segmented network using VLANs (Personal / IoT / NVR / Guest / LAB)
- Perimeter controls with ACL + NAT (Cisco ASA 5515)
- Dual-WAN load balancing + failover (MikroTik RB5009)
- Routing/switching practice on Cisco (4300 series)
- Basic services validation: DNS/DHCP, connectivity tests, and packet capture when needed

## Skills demonstrated
VLAN | NAT | ACL | Dual-WAN | Troubleshooting | Cisco IOS/ASA | MikroTik RouterOS | Wireshark | Linux basics

## Current focus
CCNA in progress. Building repeatable labs and documenting configs and troubleshooting steps.

## Next documentation to add
- Network diagram
- VLAN/IP plan
- Firewall policy overview
- Failover test notes
